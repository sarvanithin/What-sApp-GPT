WhatsApp-GPT
WhatsApp-GPT is a project that integrates ChatGPT with WhatsApp using a Golang library. The setup involves running WhatsApp from a phone number using the Golang library and concurrently running a dedicated browser in another window to control ChatGPT. Below are the steps to get started:

Prerequisites
WhatsApp Setup: Ensure that WhatsApp is running from a phone number using the Golang library specified in the project.

Run WhatsApp-GPT:

Open two terminals.
In one terminal, run go run main.go to start the WhatsApp setup.
In the second terminal, run python server.py to run the ChatGPT server.
Note: The setup might require additional configurations, and it might not work on the first run.
Alternative ChatGPT Interaction:

If you want to observe two ChatGPTs interacting, you can use multichat.py.
